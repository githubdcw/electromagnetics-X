This is for a de-embedded example.
example_deembed.son: Sonnet file without de-imbedding feedline. It is equivalent to a fabricated PCB with 2 SMA connectors.
example_deembed.s2p: Simulated result from Sonnet. It is equivalent to a measured result from VNA.
example_deembed_short.son: Sonnet file for simulating a shorted feedline.
example_deembed_with_reference_plane.son: Feedline is removed by Sonnet but it cannot be done in real measurement.
example_deembed_subtract_feedline.son: Feedline is removed by measured result (.s2p) from VNA connected with negative length feedlines on each port.
